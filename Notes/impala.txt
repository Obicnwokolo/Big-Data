#Hive runs on map reduce>> long running batch processing jobs such as ETL
-built on C++ not java
-Can be installed, configured andexecuted on the same Hadoop clusters
-Single system for big data processing and analytics
-Impala is not fault-tolerant.
-Not suitable for loading or ingesting data (ETL)
